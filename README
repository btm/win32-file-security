== Description
  Additional methods for the File class that relate to file security on
  the Microsoft Windows operating system.

== Prerequisites
  * ffi

== Installation
  gem install win32-file-security

== Synopsis

  require 'win32/file/security

  p File.owned?('file.txt')

  p File.group('file.txt')
